          My name is Pedro Mendes and I'm a Full-Stack Developer passionate
          about tecnology and thirsty of knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was 14 years old when i made my first website, using only HTML and
          CSS, and I started to delve into programming in the middle of the
          COVID pandamic, using python.
        </p>
        <p>
          After learning the concepts of programming logic, I started to study
          the web-dev trinity (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). I can't see myself
          without programming, it's my job and my hobby.
        </p>
        <p>Nowadays i build my web apps with React TSX and Node.</p>
