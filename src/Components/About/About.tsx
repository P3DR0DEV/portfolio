        A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME
      </h3>
      <p className="mx-auto my-8 w-2/3 text-center">
        My name is Pedro Mendes and I'm a Full-Stack Developer passionate about
        tecnology and thirsty of knowledge. <br /> I was 14 years old when i
        made my first website, using only HTML and CSS, and I started to delve
        into programming in the middle of the COVID pandamic, using python.
        After learning the concepts of programming logic, I started to study the
        web-dev trinity (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). I can't see myself without
        programming, it's my job and my hobby. Nowadays i build my web apps with
        React TSX and Node.
